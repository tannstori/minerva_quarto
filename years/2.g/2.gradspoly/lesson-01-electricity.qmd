This lesson covers basic electrical circuits and Ohm's law.

For example, Ohm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance:
$$
V = I\,R.
$$

- Define voltage \(V\), current \(I\), and resistance \(R\)
- Use \(V = I R\) to solve for one quantity given the others
- Understand units (volts, amperes, ohms)
- Analyze simple series and parallel circuits
